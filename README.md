Dotfiles per me!

## To install everything from scratch

1. Run `prepare.sh` to install homebrew and stow
2. Run `install.sh` to symlink everything and kick off installation

## Fonts

Fonts are stored in the `/fonts` directory. Install them however your system wants.

## Git manual installs

All installs that involve cloning a git repo, like `zsh-abbr` or `fzf` should put them in `$HOME/opt`.
