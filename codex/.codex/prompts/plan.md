description: Plan to implement a change
---

Write a plan of attack to implement the following change: """ $ARGUMENTS """

We are doing TDD so break down each step to smallest possible change that can be made in the spirit of Red -> Green -> Refactor.

Keep each step of the plan small, focused and concise.

Before writing the plan, think through the design and how you will implement it.

Write out your plan in a markdown file at @.codex/plan.md.

Group each red/green/refactor trio of the plan into Step 1 (r/g/ref), Step 2 (r/g/ref), etc. so it's easy to say things like "implement up to Step 3".
