Can you write a plan of attack to implement the design oultined in @documentation/design.md?

We are doing TDD so break down each step to smallest possible change that can be made in the spirit of Red -> Green -> Refactor.

Keep each step of the plan small, focused and concise.

Before writing the plan, think through the design and how you will implement it.

Write out your plan in a markdown file at @documentation/plan.md.
