Review and improve the set of requirements written up in @claude_docs/requirements.md.

1. Understand the overall problem to be solved, in the context of the existing requirements and out-of-scope items.
2. Identify key components and their interactions.
3. Think through data structures and algorithms that are included and/or may be required for a solution.
4. Highlight any potential issues or improvements.

At this point you will update the functional, non-functional, and out-of-scope requirements as needed based on your review.

Do not include any design, architecture, or implementation details in this requirements document. Focus solely on the requirements themselves.

After updating the requirements as necessary, then do a final pass on the full requirements document to ensure it is as clear and concise as possible, with no internal inconsistencies or ambiguities.
